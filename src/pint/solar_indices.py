"""Solar activity index downloading, caching and parsing.

Provides the external time series that solar-wind models need as a proxy:
the 10.7 cm radio flux (F10.7), the sunspot number, and in-situ solar wind
proton density from ACE.

Fetching, caching, expiration and failure are handled by
:func:`pint.observatory.global_clock_corrections.get_file`, which keys the
astropy download cache by URL, expires entries against an update interval, and
on a network error warns and returns the stale cached copy.

Series are resolved in two tiers, similar to how
:func:`pint.observatory.find_clock_file` is used for clock corrections:

1. an explicit *path* argument, or the directory named by ``$PINT_SOLAR_INDICES``
2. the upstream source, downloaded and cached

Tier 1 is what pins an analysis to a fixed snapshot, because the content behind a
fixed upstream URL changes as new data arrive.

When neither tier can supply the series, hand the arrays over directly with
:meth:`pint.models.solar_wind_dispersion.SolarWindProxyRegression.set_proxy`.
``ace_density``, which has no automatic download, is the usual case.

.. warning::

   A model whose series came from ``set_proxy`` **cannot be written to a par file
   or rebuilt from one**: a par file names a series through ``SWPRSOURCE`` but has
   nowhere to put several thousand numbers, so writing it out and reading it back
   gives a different model. ``set_proxy`` warns for that reason. It is a last
   resort in the sense of being what is left when tiers 1 and 2 cannot deliver,
   not in lookup order: arrays already loaded take precedence over
   ``SWPRSOURCE``, which is resolved only when there are none.

Examples
--------
    >>> from pint import solar_indices
    >>> mjd, flux = solar_indices.get_series("f107")
    >>> mjd, ssn = solar_indices.get_series("ssn")

    >>> mjd, flux = solar_indices.get_series("f107", download_policy="never")

    being described in a docstring, and the metadata fields record which snapshot

    solves the same problem for clock corrections: validate on construction, expose
    the data through properties, and evaluate through a method that handles the ends

    Parameters
    ----------
    mjd : array_like
        Sample epochs as MJD, UTC. Must be non-decreasing.
    value : astropy.units.Quantity or array_like
        Sample values. A plain array is taken to be dimensionless, which is right
        for the sunspot number and wrong for anything else, so prefer a Quantity.
    name : str, optional
        The :data:`SOURCES` key this came from, e.g. ``"f107"``.
    description : str, optional
        One line naming the quantity and its provider.
    url : str, optional
        Where the file was fetched from, when it was fetched.
    filename : str or Path, optional
        The file it was read from.
    retrieved : astropy.time.Time, optional
        When that file was last written, which is the age of the snapshot rather
        than the age of the data.
    sha256 : str, optional
        Hash of the file read, so a published result can name exactly its input.
    reference : str, optional
        Documentation for the series.
    smooth_days : float, optional
        Width of the smoothing already applied, 0 for the raw series. Set by
        :meth:`smoothed`; do not pass it by hand.
    smooth_kernel : str, optional
        Which of :data:`SMOOTHING_KERNELS` was applied. Set by :meth:`smoothed`;
